# Sentiment Analysis & Prediction Project
This project explores emotion classification on the GoEmotions dataset, a large-scale collection of Reddit comments labeled with 28 fine-grained emotions. Using classical machine learning models and comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), we classify emotions and gain insight into how people express sentiment in text.
